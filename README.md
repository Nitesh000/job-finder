### What is this?

---

- This is just a demo project from the youtube and it's done by using the rapid api as data source and with expo react-native.
- This just allows you to check for the jobs and nothing else.
- Just a demo appcliation not much expectations.
- First react-native application of mine.

### Assets:

- You can just download the assets from the drive. [Click here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JGUUv4g83ZBz_QgqGuh4lw0I0BRh0cq6?usp=sharing).

### Limitations:

- I have used here like free version of rapid api. So it won't let me have more than one request with this application.
- So the popular jobs won't work and the nearby job shows the list of popular jobs.
